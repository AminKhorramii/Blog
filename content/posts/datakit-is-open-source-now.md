I did a demo of DataKit at the end of Nov at Fuga and since then I had this thought that... Ok maybe it's time to go open source.

(For the record - Monday December 8th, 2025 went open source)

## What is DataKit again?

DataKit is a browser-based data analysis tool that handles everything from CSV files to Parquet, connects to your databases, and lets you query with SQL or Python - all without sending your data anywhere.

## The question I've received (a lot) in the past week - Why open source?

Honestly? Because these set of toolings should be accessible. And because the community has already been asking great questions and pushing DataKit in directions I hadn't considered.

You can find the code at https://github.com/Datakitpage/Datakit - it's AGPL-3.0 for open source projects, with commercial licensing available for enterprise use.


Is it gonna turn into a business someday? I don't know. I'll try to maintain it in my free time and bring more cool stuff. There are talks around business licenses I have these days but let's see!
